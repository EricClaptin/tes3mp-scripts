-- CellReset - Release 1 - For tes3mp 0.6.2
-- Adds automated cell resetting via server scripts.

--[[ INSTALLATION:
1) Save file as "CellReset.lua" in mp-stuff/scripts
2) Add [ CellReset = require("CellReset") ] to the top of server.lua
3) Add the following before "myMod.OnCellLoad(pid, cellDescription)" in OnCellLoad in server.lua
	[ CellReset.TryResetCell(cellDescription) ]
4) Add the following to OnServerPostInit in server.lua
	[ CellReset.Init() ]
]]

local config = {}
config.resetTime = 86400 --The time in (real life) seconds that must've passed before a cell is attempted to be reset. 259200 seconds is 3 days.
config.preserveCellChanges = true --If true, the script won't reset actors that have moved into/from the cell. At the moment, MUST be true.

--Cells entered in the blacklist are exempt from cell resets.
config.blacklist = {
--"Pelagiad, Ahnassi's House",
}

config.logging = true --If true, script outputs basic information to the log
config.debug = true --If true, script outputs debug information to the log

--[[ SCRIPT NOTES
	
How this script determines cell resetting:
1) When a player attempts to load a cell, the script checks for the last time the cell was reset. If the time since the cell was last reset exceeds the time set in the configs, it continues to the next step... (note: if the cell hasn't been loaded while this script has been installed, it won't have information about the last reset. The script adds a fake reset time set to the current time if this occurs, which means it'll always fail the first check)
2) The script checks to see if the cell is on its list of exempt cells. Server owners can manually add to this list with the blacklist config, and other scripts can add to the list automatically using the CellReset.RegisterExemptCell function. If the cell isn't on the exemption list, it continues to the next step...
3) The script checks if there are any players currently in the cell. The cell won't be reset if there are players already inside it. If there are no players inside the cell, it continues to the next step...
4) The script determines whether it should reset the cell the "easy way" or the "complicated way". If ANY online player logged in before the last player to be in the cell left it, the "complicated way" is used. Otherwise, the "easy way" is used, which simply involves jumping to step 5 :P
	4a) (The complicated way) Not yet implemented. If having to do this way, cell reset aborts.
5) The script checks for any cell data that needs to be preserved after the reset. If the preserveCellChanges config option is set to true, this'll include the information about actors who have left/entered the cell. Afterwards, the cell's data will be wiped, excluding anything that was set to be preserved, and the cell will be reset!

Current Limits:
> Can't reset cell if anybody in the server has been online since a player has been in the cell. Requires somewhat complicated undoing of packets that I'll have to work on.
> Must have preserveCellChanges config enabled. Meaning that data file actors won't be returned to their original cells on cell reset.

--Notes on base tes3mp carp:
> When players login, they're given an initTimestamp set to os.time()
> If data file actor is moved to different cell:
	- The game ports their object data to the new cell, including associated packets
	- In the original cell the game stores a "cellChangeTo" packet for the object. The object data for the actor in the original cell is used solely for storing the object's new cell: keyed under "cellChangeTo", the cellDescription of the cell the actor was moved to is stored.
> If a data file actor that has been moved from its starting cell is deleted (e.g. they were killed and their body disposed of):
	- In the cell the actor was moved into, the game deletes all data related to the actor object (object data, any associated packets, including cellChangeFrom)
	- In the original cell, the cellChangeFrom packet is removed. The actor's objectData is replaced with a table solely containing the actor's refId under the respective key. A delete packet is stored for the object.
	
TODO:
> Implement complicated way
> Implement system for detailing specific reset instructions.
> Maybe add option for ingame time instead of IRL time
